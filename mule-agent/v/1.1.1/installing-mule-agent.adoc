link:/release-notes/mule-agent-1.1.1-release-notes[Mule Agent 1.1.1 Release Notes]

Mule agent version 1.1.1 now installs as a plugin from a zip file available at link:http://mule-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/1.1.1/mule-agent-1.1.1.zip[http://mule-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/1.1.1/mule-agent-1.1.1.zip].

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Mule 3.7.x and API Gateway 2.x already provide the new Mule agent software. If you have these versions, follow the installation instructions described in
link:<<Installing from a Software Distribution>>

* Restart Mule after installing the software.
====

== Prerequisites

The Mule agent continues to be available with the Mule and API Gateway software distributions; however, you should use the new zip version to update your Mule agent to the latest version so that you get the benefits of important bug fixes as well as the ability to safeguard custom JARs.

This document assumes that your enterprise license is current. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/installing-an-enterprise-license[Installing an Enterprise License] for information on obtaining and installing an enterprise license.

Mule agent works with Mule 3.6.0 and newer, and API Gateway 2.0 and newer.

[TIP]
We recommend that you run the latest version of Mule Enterprise. You can download the latest version from the link:http://www.mulesoft.com/support-login[customer portal].

== Installing the Agent from the Zip File

The link:http://mule-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/1.1.1/mule-agent-1.1.1.zip[Mule Agent version 1.1.1 zip file] provides a new simplified installation procedure for installing the Mule agent plugin for Mule Enterprise users. This release works correctly with existing Mule and API Gateway installations. In addition, this release introduces a new *modules folder*. This feature lets you keep your custom JAR modules in a different location from the Mule software so that you can update your Mule software without affecting your custom agent extensions.

The agent zip file contains these 3 files - the `amc_setup` files install the Mule agent plugin.

* `amc_setup` - Mac and Linux installation file
* `amc_setup.bat` - Windows installation file
* `agent-setup-<version>.jar` - Called by the installation files

The installed Mule agent works correctly with Mule and GW runtimes versions that include the agent in the distribution.

=== Running the Updater

After downloading the Mule agent zip file:

. Stop Mule or the API Gateway runtime. You can stop Mule with the `./bin stop` command or by killing the process. Restart Mule with the `./bin start` command. For information on starting and stopping API Gateway, see link:[Configuring an API Gateway].
. Unzip the `agent-installer-*.zip` to the `$MULE_HOME/bin` folder.
. Run `./amc_setup -U` to update the agent version. If you are using Windows, run: `amc_setup.bat -U`.

=== Agent Update Process

. Back up the current version of the agent (everything under `$MULE_HOME/plugins/MULE_AGENT_PLUGIN_FOLDER`) within `$MULE_HOME/tools` folder.
. Update agent libs under `$MULE_HOME/plugins/MULE_AGENT_PLUGIN_FOLDER/lib`
. Keep modules under `$MULE_HOME/plugins/MULE_AGENT_PLUGIN_FOLDER/lib/modules` unchanged. All custom modules added to the agent that are not included in the agent distribution should be installed in this folder.
. No reregistration is needed after the process is done, just restart the Mule or API Gateway instance.

== Installing from a Software Distribution

The following sections explain how to install from either the link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule[Mule Runtime] or API Gateway on premise installations. 

The agent comes bundled with your Mule installation. You can install it by running `$MULE_HOME/bin/amc_setup` (or `$MULE_HOME\bin\amc_setup.bat` if on Windows).

*Mule 3.6.0 and 3.6.1 Installation:*

Download the agent and follow the steps in the previous link:[Installing the Agent from the Zip File] section. Then run `amc_setup` or `amc_setup.bat` depending on your OS.

Where:

* _Proxy Host_ - The host of the desired proxy.
* _Proxy Port_ - The port of the desired proxy.
* _Proxy User_ - The user with which to authenticate against the proxy.
* _Proxy Password_ - The password with which to authenticate against the proxy.

If you have already installed the Mule agent and want to change its configuration to use a proxy, you can do so by editing the `wrapper.conf` file. For details, see link:[Configuring a Proxy for the Mule Agent].


== Configuring the Agent

The sections that follow provide additional configuration details for Mule agent.

=== Configuring mule-agent.yml

At startup, the Mule agent reads its configuration from the file `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml`. You must manually add, then edit this file with your installation's configuration parameters.

==== Configuration File Structure

The `mule-agent.yml` file is structured in three levels:

* First level: Component types: transports, services, internalHandlers, and externalHanders.
** Second level: Component name, for example, `mule.agent.jmx.publisher.service`.
*** Third level: Component configuration. A component can have complex object configurations, including more than one recursive level.

To learn more on how to configure the Mule agent, refer to the documentation of each component.

==== Configuring During Runtime

Some agent components allow you to configure them during runtime. For further information, see link:/mule-agent/v/1.1.1/administration-service[Administration Service].

== Enabling REST Agent Transport and Websocket Transport

When you register the API Gateway in AMC, the generated `mule-agent.yml` disables the REST agent Transport.

Conversely, if you run `./amc_setup -I`, you enable the REST agent Transport and disable the WebSocket Transport, that is the one used to connect to AMC.

To run both transports, modify the `mule-agent.yml` file as follows:

[source,yaml, linenums]
----
transports:
  websocket.transport:
    consoleUri: wss://mule-manager.anypoint.mulesoft.com:443/mule
    security:
      keyStorePassword: <password>
      keyStoreAlias: agent
      keyStoreAliasPassword: <password>
